* Description

This layer add config for the fastest lsp client - lsp-bridge.

lsp-bridge has not been supported by spacemacs, which includes the lsp-mode
package in the lsp layer as the default LSP client. Currently, lsp-bridge and
lsp-mode are not compatible.

Now, it is just a trail run for me to use lsp-bridge.
