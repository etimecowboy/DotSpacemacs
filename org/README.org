** BibTeX
For more extensive support of references through BibTeX files, have a look at
the [[../+lang/bibtex][BibTeX layer]].

** Important Note
Since version 0.104, spacemacs uses the =org= version from the org ELPA
repository instead of the one shipped with emacs. Then, any =org= related code
should not be loaded before =dotspacemacs/user-config=, otherwise both versions
will be loaded and will conflict.

Because of autoloading, calling to =org= functions will trigger the loading up
of the =org= shipped with emacs which will induce conflicts.
One way to avoid conflict is to wrap your =org= config code in a
=with-eval-after-load= block like this:


* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =myorg= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.
